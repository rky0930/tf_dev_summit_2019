### tf.function and Autograph
  - Why graphs ? If we have graphs, 
      - We can get full program optimization on some hardware like TPU
      - We can take a model and deploy it on server, mobile devices and whatever thing you want
  - So, Just keep doing with graphs ? No
  - TensorFlow is fundamentally changing the programming model in v2.0
    - Removing the model that first add a bunch of nodes to a graph and then rely on session that run to prune things out of the graph to figure out the precise thins you want to running the correct order.
    - Replaceing it with a much simpler model based on this notion of a function
    - It's "tf.function()"
    - User will never have to use session or run anymore
  - tf.function()
    - A function is like an op
      - Just like an operation execpt one that user get to define using composition of the other operations intensive flow
      - Once have the funtion, 
        - User call it in inside another function
        - User can take it's gradient
        - User can run it on the GPU, TPU, CPU, distributed things
      - Just like how user do with any other tensorflow operation
    - Functions can be faster than eager code
      - If user look at models there are large convolutions or big matrix multiplications large reductions, it's not actually any faster becuase the eager excution is pretty fast
      - Whereas models get small and the operations get small, tf.function speed up tensorflow.
        - ex) Tenfold speed up if user used tf.funtion with tiny lstm cells of ten units
      - Functions are polymorphic
        - Tensorflow graph is very much not polymorphic
          - ex) A graph built for a float64 cannot use float32 or float16
        - but tf.function is like python code tends to be very free into the types
        - So, User just use the tf.function as normal tensorflow operation
        - the autograph build up user's code to graph and the graph run blazingly fast
        - And, It's not completely hidden, User can access to the graph that is generated
        - If user need to manipulate the graphs, user still can do it
  - State in tf.function
    - Never write tf.control_dependencies again
      - Automatic control dependencies
  - Variables in tf.function
    - Nerver use tf.global_variables_initializer again
      - User don't need to manually initialize variables
      - Non-ambiguous code is ok
      - Inializers can be path-dependent
  - Control flow in tf.function
    - Breaking up with tf.{cond, while_loop}
      - python compiler called autograph that rewrite control flow expression into faster dynamic graph code
        - How do we customize python ?
          - Operator overloading !
            - \_\_add\_\_, \_\_sub\_\_, etc
          - We can't overload \_\_if\_\_
            - Sadly, no \_\_if\_\_, \_\_while\_\_, etc
          - Autograph:
            - it overload \_\_if\_\_, \_\_while\_\_, etc
              - Tensorflow compiler called autograph that take user's python code and rewrite it in a for that lets us call \_\_if\_\_, \_\_while\_\_, etc on tensors
  - Summary
    - session.run goes away
    - tf.control_dependencies goes away
    - tf.global_variables_initilizer goes away
    - tf.cond, tf.while_loop goes away
    - Just use tf.funtion like how we would use in a normal programming language

### TensorFlow Datasets
  - It's new way to have a collection of public research datasets
  - It's on GitHub and Pypy and ready to use with tensorflow 
  - Data and Models 
    - The ML partnership
    - tf.data
      - High-performance and flexible input pipelines
      - Data is a little out of step
        - Every single dataset is little bit different
        - User is just interesed in having data in a format that sort of ready to move into TF data pipeline
        - Google and user really want that data and models to be simpatico
      - TensorFlow Datasets
        - Let's play nice
          - import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
          - train_ds = tfds.load("<NAME_OF_DATASET>/<ENCODING_TYPE>", split="train", as_superviesed=True)
          - train_ds = train_dataset.shuffle(1024).batch(128)
          - for input, targets in train_ds.repeat(10): # using with loop
          - ... 
      - class DatasetBuilder
        - Each of tf.dataset is packaged together as a datasetBuilder
          - First, it had a method called download and prepare
          - Second, as_dataset. as_dataset take those pre-processed files on disk and produces a tf.data.dataset
          - Third, Useful information. Metadata about the dataset which can be programmatically useful.
            - DatasetInfo
              - Documenting objects 
              - features (shape, class label)
              - total_num_examples
              - splits (train, test)
              - etc
      - TensorFlow Datasets support NumPy usage too
        - tfds.as_numpy(...)
          - It hide all the tensorflow from user
          - return python generator over numpy array
      - Installation
        - pip install tensorflow-datasets

    - Pick an optimizer and random input then pick a training loop
    - Code example
  - Demo: Basic Workflow
    - Modifying machine learning models
      - Environment
        - Google collab hosted Jupyter notebooks and It comes with Swift for TensorFlow
      - First try:
        - Initiate a model
        - Use stocastic gradient descent SDG optimizer
        - Just train a model using swift for tensorflow
        - Start training 
        - Found the loss is decreased 
      - Second try:
        - Add dense layers
        - Add skip connection
        - Re-run training loop
      - This is an example of what it's like to use Swift tensorflow to develop and iterate as you apply models to applications 
  - Swift for tensorflow was designed for researchers
    - Researchers often .. 
      - need to do more than just change models
      - change the way the archtecture fits together
      - need to define entirely new abstractions or layers
    - Writing custom layers
      - Define DoubleBiasDenseLayer
      - Code example
      - Initiate
      - Training using custom hand write training loop
    - Simulate running on a super large data parallel GPU or TPU cluster on a single machine
      - Experimenting with batch sizes
        - Custom training loop
          - Additional inner loop
          - Run forward pass
          - Take the gradients for each step and aggregate them in this grads variable
          - Simulates running on four independent accelerateors four GPUS
          - So plexable
  - No boundary: Interoperability
    - No wrappers, Just import it, then call it  
    - Demo: Interoperability
      - Seamless Python Interoperability
        - Import Tensoflow
        - Import Python
        - The Python object that allow you to import arbitray python libraries
        - ex) matplotlib.pyplot and numpy from python
        - Run the plt.plot and numpy and they just works
        - Looks like the python code but it's actually pure Swift
        - Just works seamlessly 
      - RL with OpenAI Gym
        - Import Gym
        - Define neural network
        - Use cart pole v-0 environment
        - Run 
        - Get gradient
        - Record the mean reward 
        - Train
        - It's all very simple straight forward Swift 
        - User can train using Swift TensorFlow model in an openAI gym environment using Python bridge. Totally seamless
        - User can keep train of the parameters of the rewards and plot the mean rewards as the model train using Python Numpy. Totally seamless
  - No boundary: Differentiable programming
    - Demo: Differentiable Programming
      - Differential Programming
        - annotate @differentiable then tensorflow will derive the derivative for the function
          - Just plain old double is used becuased automatic differentiation is built right into the language
      - Custom differential data types
        - @differentiable helps catch errors
        - Maginitude of point
          - Swift doesn't include a square root function because I want a good excuse for you to see the interoperability with C
          - We're actually goint to use a C's square root function that operates on doubles
          - Error occured, Why ?
            - Square root function is compiled by the C compiler and today the C compiler can't automaticcally compute deribatives for you 
          - This is great excuse to show you how to write custom gradients
          - So, create own square root function with swift
      - Demo Summary
        - How to use 
          - customization
          - custom gradients
          - custom datatypes with the language integrated automatic differentiation built into swift for TensorFlow
