      - Model conversion 
        - Steps
          - TensorFlow -> Savede Model -> TF Lite Converter -> TF Lite Model
        - failures & solutions
          - Limited ops => Tensorflow Select
            - In the pipeline(future work): TensorFlow Select + Selective Registration
          - Unsupported semantics (e.g. control-flow in RNNs) => Not yet
            - In the pipeline(future work): Control flow support (e.g. loops conditions)
        - Tensorflow Select

            - Selective registration
              - Selective registration is already something user can take adavangate of TensorFlow Lite for our building ops. So, user only include in the binary the ops that user is really using. So, user don't end up increasing user's binary size unnecessarily
            - Improved performance
              - Trying to blur the of the TensorFlow ops and the Tensorflow Lite ops are. One of the key points of this is blur the performance gap that there might be between one and the other  <--- blur ?? blow ??
        - Control flow support
          - In the pipeline(future work)
            - Control flow are core to many ops(e.g RNNs) and graphs. Thus TensorFlow Lite team is adding support for:

              - Conditions
        - Converter 2.0
          - Follow users feedback! TensorFlow Lite team is building a new converter that will answer:

        - SavedModel -> Tensorflow Lite
    - Before we go.. 2 last thing !
      - 1) Pretty Cool New Project by Pete Warden - MCU
        - Tiny models on tiny computers !
          - Microcontroller are everywhere
          - Speech researchers were pioneers
          - Models just tens of kilobytes
        - Why the models had to be so small ? 
          - To save battery !
          - Microcontrollers use far less power than CPUs
          - Main CPU is turned off while MCU listens
          - Only tens of kilobytes of RAM and Flash available
          - No cloud connection
        - Pete thought this approach would be widely useful
          - Open up voice interfaces to more developers
          - Work with other kinds of noisy sensor data
        - Google releasing the first experimental support for embedded platforms in tensorflow light
          - Pocket size demonstration board is showed up !

            - 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4F processor with Direct Memory Access
            - 48MHz CPU clock, 96MHz with TurboSPOT‚Ñ¢
            - Extremely low-power usage: 6uA/MHz
            - 1MB Flash
            - 384KB SRAM
            - Dedicated Bluetooth processor with BLE 5
            - Available to run on a single coin battery for many days ! 
          - Live Demo by Pete Warden

            - Yellow light blink
            - [Demo Video Link](https://youtu.be/DKosV_-4pdQ?t=1951)
        - Why is this useful ?
          - Running entirely on-device
          - Tiny constraints
            - It's using a 20 KB model
            - Run using less than 100KB of RAM and 80KB of Flash
          - All Open Source & Train your own model

        - Hyperparameter Tuning
          - Available in the TF 2.0 alpha
          - A couple of hyper-parameters
            - Dropout rate, the number of units, the dense layer and optimizer
          - How to use ?
            - Several additional import
            - Define which values of the hyperparameters user want to try
              - Ex) num_units_list = [16, 32]
              - dropout_rate_list = [0.1, 0.2]
              - optimizer_list = ['adam']
            - Define matrix
